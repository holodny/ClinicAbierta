# ClinicAbierta
This is a demo for the ClinicAbierta project to explore issues with multi-camera recording and playback.

ClinicAbierta is a project I began to explore open source software for use in recording and playing back healthcare training and 
simulation.  I was unhappy with the  software I was using at the time and I thought it would be interesting to attempt to develop open source solutions.
